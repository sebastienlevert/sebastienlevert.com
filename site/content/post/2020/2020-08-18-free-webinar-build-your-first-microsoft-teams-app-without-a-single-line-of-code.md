On August 20th at 1PM ET, I'll be hosted by my good friend Vlad Catrinescu, Microsoft MVP, for a webinar where you will
learn how to build a Microsoft Teams app without a single line of code!

## Abstract

Microsoft Teams offer an amazing ecosystem for developers to build applications that deliver high value to your
organization, but if you are not a developer, this could seem like a tough challenge.

In this webinar, join Microsoft MVP Sébastien Levert to learn how you can leverage native tools like the App Studio and
use your existing investments to magically transform them into Microsoft Teams Apps! We will also look at how Microsoft
Flow can deliver great content to your Teams channel to keep you up to date with all the signals that happen around you.
By the end of this session, not only you will be able to use those apps for yourself, but you will also learn how to
distribute them across your entire organization!

In this webinar, attendees will learn how to use the App Studio, they will get a basic knowledge of Microsoft Power
Automate adaptive cards action to bring content into Microsoft Teams and they will also learn the apps governance around
Microsoft Teams.
