## Office 365 Sparx

This video is part of a video series of quick tips and tricks about the overall SharePoint and Office 365 space. Less
writing, short videos, to the point. The idea is that after 2 or 3 minutes of watching time, your can already benefit
from the content I'm sharing.

## Use the forceLocale parameter to debug Localizations in SPFx

In my daily work, I'm using a lot of different Office 365 tenant in a lot of different languages. This is great but
makes quick testing of our localizations a little bit difficult as there a lot of settings involved in testing
multilingual solutions (browser language, regional settings, etc.). I found a great tool today and it's to use the
_forceLocale_ parameter in any SharePoint page! Just use it like this and you will be able to switch language upon
request!

In this video, I walk you through the "how-to" of utilizing this small gem.
