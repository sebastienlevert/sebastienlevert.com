It's been a while since I posted here, but I am looking into getting back to blogging rapidly! In the meantime, a lot of great thing happened and I wanted to recap the last couple of months.

## 2toLead

I had an amazing experience working with one of the most qualified team of SharePoint and Office 365 professionals in a very long time. When I joined [2toLead](https://www.2tolead.com) in July 2016, I was not expecting that much of awesomeness from the team. I had to work on amazing challenging projects and I was able to get back to have my hands dirty by conducting the Development team best practices. It was a great way for me to get back to the roots and enjoy the power of code for a little while. I missed it as in the last couple of years I was more in the team management and sales side of things. I just want to thank everyone I worked with and looking forward meeting you again! SharePoint and Office 365 world is small, let's connect soon!

## Valo Intranet

My next endeavour is a very exciting and challenging one! I accepted a role of Product Evangelist and Partner Manager with the awesome team of [Valo Intranet](https://www.valointranet.com). I've always wanted to play deeply in the Office 365 & SharePoint Product industry and that role gives me the chance to have a great experience in that sphere. 

I will be driving the product evangelism in North American where I will help building the Valo brand at events and online webinars. I will be also responsible to gather partners all over America and help them deliver quality Intranet solutions based on Valo to their own customers.

I'd like to thank the [Sininen Meteoriitti](https://www.meteoriitti.com/in-english/) team for their trust and I know that we will build great things this year! To use a very popular hashtag : #MakeValoInAmericaGreatAgain

See you soon in an event near you!
