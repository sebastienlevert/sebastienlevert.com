Last week, from November 9th to 12th, I had the privilege to host a session at the latest [European SharePoint Conference](http://www.sharepointeurope.com) in the amazing city of Stockholm! I was part of the Office Development track and presented on AngularJS and its integration with the Microsoft Graph.

The session's abstract was the following :

"Every developer hears about AngularJS and all the magic it does for you applications. In order to kickstart you AngularJS journey, this session is an introduction to the AngularJS concepts applied to any Office 365 development. Different workloads will be targeted (Mail, Calendar, Files) and the Office 365 API will be our main datasource. We will also cover SharePoint Online specific data access (Office 365 API, REST, CSOM and Search) to meet your current development needs.

The 3 key takeaways of this session are :

- You will understand the basics of the AngularJS framework
- You will learn how to communicate withthe Office 365 through AngularJS
- You will be able to apply those new skills in your next project"
