My next speaking engagement is gonna be an epic one! A good friend of mine, [Luc Labelle](https://twitter.com/luc_labelle) from [Kabesa](http://kabesa.ca/) and 2 awesome MVPs from Ottawa and Toronto ([Rez Khamis](https://twitter.com/nkhamis) and [Mike Maadarani](https://twitter.com/mikemaadarani)), with the help of several other MVPs from all over Canada, are throwing an amazing series of events during the second week of February. From February 6th until February 10th, we will be travelling from Quebec City to Toronto (which is 807 km!) in a bus to meet SharePoint, Office 365 and Microsoft Cloud enthusiasts!

As said on the website : 

>*The aOS Canadian Tour 2017 is a conference taking place in four different Canadian cities, over the span of five days. Starting February 6th we will tour from Quebec City, to Montreal, Ottawa all the way down to Toronto with some of the most influential speakers from Europe and Canada.*

>*We are aiming at delivering over 60 sessions to over more than 360 attendees and share our knowledge about some of the most common challenges organizations are dealing with when integrating Azure, Office 365 or SharePoint in their digitization strategies.*

>*The aOS Canadian Tour is a free event aimed at both technical and non technical audiences but with a focus on the business challenges and the value technology can bring to the organization. Our main objective is to share our experiences and expertise with people trying to make their organization more productive and efficient by using technology.*

What is absolutely awesome of this Canadian Tour is that every event is free and will be delivered by local and international MVPs throughout the week! If you want to learn about the [Microsoft MVP program](https://mvp.microsoft.com/) and how to become an MVP, [Simran Chaudry](https://twitter.com/sim_100), Community Program Manager from Microsoft Canada will be there to answer all your questions !

During this week, I will be delivering my session on how to become an Office 365 Developer when you have a SharePoint Development background. The abstract is the following : 

>*The world around the Office Developer is changing. And for someone with a heavy SharePoint background, it can be somewhat scary to make the move to the cloud. But don't be scared, SharePoint Developer! Become an added-value Office Developer and contribute to maximize the productivity of your enterprise.*

>*The technology space around Productivity has evolved and it has never been that exciting. Your step into the Mobile-First, Cloud-First world will be mindblowing and you will want to stick around for a very long time!*

>*In this session, we will cover every aspect of the new Office 365 Developer paradigm and we will ensure that you can make yourself at home in such a new world. The technologies covered will span from being close to your existing stack (SharePoint Framework, JavaScript) to a set of technologies that are new and that will expand your possibilities (Office 365 Apps, Microsoft Graph, Azure, TypeScript)*

>*This very session will make sure that at the end you get those 3 key takeaways :*

>*- Understand your new role as an Office 365 Developer
- Have a complete overview of the technology stack you need to master in the cloud
- Change the way you will think for your next SharePoint & Office 365 project*

Can't wait to do the trip and see you all across Canada!
