Last weekend, I had the pleasure to host a session during the very popular SharePoint Saturday New York City 2015! This session was all about PowerShell and how you can leverage your own Office 365 data in a scripted way.

First of all, the event was awesome. The venue and the attendees were more than perfect to me! Food, organization and the volunteers were great and we had a lot of fun! 

The "French Connection" was all over the place with 6 sessions and we had a great weekend in the city! Those crazy french folks were all over the place :

* [Vincent Biret](https://www.twitter.com/baywet) (SharePoint MVP)
* [Nicolas Georgeault](https://www.twitter.com/ngeorgeault) (SharePoint MVP)
* [Gokan Ozcfici](https://www.twitter.com/GokanOzcifci) (SharePoint MVP)
* [Julien Stroheker](https://www.twitter.com/Ju_Stroh) (Azure MVP)
* [Serge Tremblay](https://www.twitter.com/sergepoint) (SharePoint MVP)

Here is some cool pictures of the event, including the speakers social that happened on Friday night! (Thanks to the Belgium master of selfied, Gokan, for the pictures!)
