## Office 365 Sparx
This video is part of a video series of quick tips and tricks about the overall SharePoint and Office 365 space. Less writing, short videos, to the point. The idea is that after 2 or 3 minutes of watching time, your can already benefit from the content I'm sharing.

## How to search for your Hubsite data using the SharePoint Search API
I (really) love building Search-based solutions on SharePoint Online and something I'm doing everyday is to make sure that the data shown to users is contextualized and relevant. I think Hubsites are great for that as it creates a virtual boundary that I can then leverage to aggregate data.

In this video, I introduce an amazing tool to help you debug and build SharePoint Search queries quickly and how to leverage the DepartmentId managed property as part of your Search-based solutions.
