There is one day every year that is stressful (but very exciting at the same time!) for MVPs : July 1st! This year was no difference and I'm happy to announce that I was awarded the Ofice Development MVP for a 5th consecutive year!

You can see my MVP profile and all my latest contributions [here](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5001092?fullName=S%C3%A9bastien%20Levert). 

This year, I want to give myself new challenges to help me contribute in my MVP area and to give even more to my local community and to the ones I meet when I travel abroad :

* I want to contribute to the [PnP initiative](https://github.com/pnp) by committing code to the project
* I want to contribute to the [SharePoint Framework samples](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-samples) to ease the development of new comers to this new technique
* I want to restart a podcast around the Office 365 ecosystem and invite my local community to have the opportunity to share on their favorite subjects
* I want to do more vlogs with my Office 365 Sparx initiative that I started last year

A small thank you note to the people around me that are always supporting me and let me do my crazy trips and my sleepless nights to get things done!

Cheers!
