Last month, on July 9th, I had the privilege to travel to Tonronto for the latest edition of [SharePoint Saturday Toronto](http://www.spsevents.org/city/toronto/toronto2016)! It was also for me the chance to meet in person for the first time my new team at [2toLead](http://www.2tolead.com)!

I gave a hands-on session on AngularJS and its integration with the Microsoft Graph.

The session's abstract was the following :

"Every developer hears about AngularJS and all the magic it does for you applications. In order to kickstart you AngularJS journey, this session is an introduction to the AngularJS concepts applied to any Office 365 development. Different workloads will be targeted (Mail, Calendar, Files) and the Office 365 API will be our main datasource. We will also cover SharePoint Online specific data access (Office 365 API, REST, CSOM and Search) to meet your current development needs.

The 3 key takeaways of this session are :

- You will understand the basics of the AngularJS framework
- You will learn how to communicate withthe Office 365 through AngularJS
- You will be able to apply those new skills in your next project"
