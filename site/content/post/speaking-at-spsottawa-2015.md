Next Saturday, on November 21st, I will have the privilege to hold a session in Ottawa during next SharePoint Saturday! I am attending this event since its first edition and it has always been a great event, with world-class speakers, useful content and awesome interactions with the attendees.

This year, #SPSOttawa has a theme! The sessions will target the "SharePoint Evolution". The sessions will have a special focus on SharePoint 2016, Office 365, and Cloud and hybrid architectures. Feel free to bring your questions around those subjects to the speakers!

**The schedule**

The schedule has been published and it will be great! You can see it right here and no matter what type of SharePoint expert you are, you will find your way in the impressive lineup! Check it out right here : http://www.spsevents.org/city/Ottawa/Ottawa2015/schedule

The only thing that is missing to this event? You! The event is free and you will enjoy great snacks and lunch! This will allow you to attend one of the best event of the year, learn cool stuff around the Microsoft Productivity tools and meet a bunch of other passionates! Don't hesitate, registration is here : http://www.spsevents.org/city/ottawa/ottawa2015/_layouts/15/spsevents/registrations/registrationform.aspx

**Give!**

The team is also inviting you to donate canned food to the Ottawa Food Bank to help those in need. You can help by bringing non-perishable food items (no cash) to the event and we will deliver them to the Food Bank for you. Information on what to bring is here: http://www.ottawafoodbank.ca/donate/#scroll-food

**My session**

This year, I will do a session on PowerShell into Office 365 and the Office 365 API. This session is mainly targeting developers and IT Pro.

The session abstract is the following : "In a world where we ear more and more about DevOps and continuous integration, your Office 365 integration process might be lacking some good practices and ways to automate everything. In this session, we will cover how you can use PowerShell to ease the deployment process of your applications, the monitoring of your tenants and the maintenance of all the workloads of Office 365. Being a demo-intensive session, be prepared to see a lot of PowerShell and Office 365 API code!"

See you on Saturday!
