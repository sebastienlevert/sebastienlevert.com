## Office 365 Sparx

This video is part of a video series of quick tips and tricks about the overall SharePoint and Office 365 space. Less
writing, short videos, to the point. The idea is that after 2 or 3 minutes of watching time, your can already benefit
from the content I'm sharing.

## How to use the Browser Preview VS Code Extension with #SPFx

I'm using Visual Studio Code (almost) everyday and I was excited when the
[Browser Preview VS Code Extension](https://github.com/auchenberg/vscode-browser-preview) was announced as I really
think this can speed up your development workflow!

I was thinking "I'm sure this would work super nicely with the Local and Hosted Workbench of SharePoint... Let me test
this out"! And you know what? It's pure awesomeness!
