## Office 365 Sparx

This video is part of a video series of quick tips and tricks about the overall SharePoint and Office 365 space. Less
writing, short videos, to the point. The idea is that after 2 or 3 minutes of watching time, your can already benefit
from the content I'm sharing.

## How to stay updated on #SPFx using Twitter

I'm using Twitter everyday to figure out what's new in SharePoint, Office 365, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Graph, etc. To
achieve this, I have a pretty intense [TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com) setup that I use to make sure I don't
miss on any news. When it comes to #SPFx news, the issue is that the SharePoint Framework official hashtag is also used
by a lot of people in the Special Effects scene. Why does it matter to me? I'm not looking forward seeing wounds all
over my Twitter feed! This video covers how you can do a specific Search Query that will give you only the content you
really care about, aka the SharePoint-related content!
