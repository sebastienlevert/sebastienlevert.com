A quick post today to invite you to connect with me and 100+ more speakers from around the globe during the European SharePoint Conference 2015! If you are still not sure if you need to attend the event, I have 3 very good reasons that will help you take a decision!

**Awesome headline keynote**

The headline keynote will be given by 3 of the master brains of SharePoint and Office 365! Seth Patton (Global Senior Director of SharePoint & OneDrive), Jeff Teper (Corporate Vice President SharePoint & OneDrive) & Bill Baer (Senior Technical Product Manager) will be able to give technical details and vision about the next version of SharePoint and Office 365!

**Challenging Hackathon**

The Hackathon held by the OfficeDev team and Jeremy Thake on Tuesday night will be an awesome opportunity to come play with the APIs around Office 365 !
