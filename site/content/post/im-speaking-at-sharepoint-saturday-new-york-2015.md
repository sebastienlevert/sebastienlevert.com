title: I'm speaking at SharePoint Saturday New York 2015 !
---


During the day of the 25th of July 2015, I will have the chance and honour to host a session during the SharePoint Saturday that will be hosted in New York City!

This event will be hosted directly in the Microsoft Offices on Times Square and will feature a list of very impressive SharePoint, Office 365 and Azure speakers!

I will be conducting a session on "Office 365 and PowerShell : A match made in heaven" aimed at Developers and IT Pro.

## Office 365 and PowerShell : A match made in heaven
>In a world where we ear more and more about DevOps and continuous integration, your Office 365 integration process might be lacking some good practices and ways to automate everything. In this session, we will cover how you can use PowerShell to ease the deployment process of your applications, the monitoring of your tenants and the maintenance of all the workloads of Office 365. Being a demo-intensive session, be prepared to see a lot of PowerShell and Office 365 API code!

>The 3 key takeaways of this session are :

>* You will learn how to communicate with the Office 365 API from PowerShell
* You will be introduced to DevOps concepts in a Office 365 context
* You will be able to reproduce those easy processes without problem back at work

When I will be back from the event, I will make sure to share the slides and the PowerShell code that will have been used throughout the session!
