title: SharePoint Saturday New York 2015
---

Last weekend, I had the pleasure to host a session during the very popular SharePoint Saturday New York City 2015! This
session was all about PowerShell and how you can leverage your own Office 365 data in a scripted way.

First of all, the event was awesome. The venue and the attendees were more than perfect to me! Food, organization and
the volunteers were great and we had a lot of fun!

The "French Connection" was all over the place with 6 sessions and we had a great weekend in the city! Those crazy
french folks were all over the place :

- [Nicolas Georgeault](https://www.twitter.com/ngeorgeault) (SharePoint MVP)
- [Gokan Ozcfici](https://www.twitter.com/GokanOzcifci) (SharePoint MVP)
- [Julien Stroheker](https://www.twitter.com/Ju_Stroh) (Azure MVP)
- [Serge Tremblay](https://www.twitter.com/sergepoint) (SharePoint MVP)

Here is some cool pictures of the event, including the speakers social that happened on Friday night! (Thanks to the
Belgium master of selfied, Gokan, for the pictures!)
