I had the pleasure and privilege to hold a session during last [SPBiz](http://www.spbizconf.com) Conference. It was a
great experience and I had a blast exchanging with lots of Business users about the SharePoint story about forms and
authoring experiences.

## My session

My session was all about forms! It can be found here
(https://spbiz.conferencehosts.com/confs/2015-1/spbiz07/ConfPages/SessionRoom.aspx) if you register! This subject is one
that is very important to me. How many times did we had to work on different alternatives to regular SharePoint forms?
Every project has a moment where SharePoint forms are not enough anymore. And this is where we built all those tips &
tricks around the forms-story.

The abstract of the sessions was this one :

> SharePoint, being a list and data driven platform, is all about forms and the options that are left to the power users
> seem to be very limited. This session will uncover useful tips on how to leverage different SharePoint components to
> enhance any SharePoint form. By using all native configurations, even if Microsoft did not provide a real replacement
> for InfoPath yet, you will be able to customize your SharePoint forms and be considered a real Rock Star!

## The speaking experience

Our hosts, Collaboris and all their sponsors, were amazing people to work with. You can't even imagine the amount of
work they have put in to be able to deliver a quality conference for free to more dans 3200 attendees! Always there to
help you when you need, listening to our questions, bending limits to allow speakers to deliver the best sessions... I
have to say that they deserve a HUGE round of applause for what they did. It was a great experience and I can't wait for
their next event (a pretty insane one) with Collab365, the 24-hours long Collaboration conference on October 8th 2015
(http://www.collab365.events/).
