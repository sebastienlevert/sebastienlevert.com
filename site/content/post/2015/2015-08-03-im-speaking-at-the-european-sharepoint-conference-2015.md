In case you missed it, the
[European SharePoint Conference 2015 programme](http://www.sharepointeurope.com/conferences/2015/european-sharepoint-conference-2015-programme)
is now available and I'm delighted to announce that I am speaking at Europe's largest SharePoint and office 365 event in
Stockholm Sweden from 9th-12th November 2015.

I will be conducting a session on "Introduction to AngularJS in an Office 365 context" aimed at Developers.

## Introduction to AngularJS in an Office 365 context

> Every developer hears about AngularJS and all the magic it does for your applications. In order to kickstart you
> AngularJS journey, this session is an introduction to the AngularJS concepts applied to any Office 365 development.
> Different workloads will be targeted (Mail, Calendar, Files) and the Office 365 API will be our main datasource. We
> will also cover SharePoint Online specific data access (Office 365 API, REST, CSOM and Search) to meet your current
> development needs.

> As a developer, you will learn the basic concepts of AngularJS and will be able to use those in an Office 365 context.
> You will be able to build rich applications (Single Page Application) and forms that will simplify your development
> process.
