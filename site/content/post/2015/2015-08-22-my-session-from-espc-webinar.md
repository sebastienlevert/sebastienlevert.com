title: European SharePoint Conference Webinar
---

Last week, on August 15th, I had the privilege to hold a webinaire with the European SharePoint Community that was
called "Office 365 and PowerShell : A match made in heaven". This session was mainly targeting developers and IT Pros on
how to integrate PowerShell code with the Office 365 APIs.

The session's abstract was the following : "In a world where we ear more and more about DevOps and continuous
integration, your Office 365 integration process might be lacking some good practices and ways to automate everything.
In this session, we will cover how you can use PowerShell to ease the deployment process of your applications, the
monitoring of your tenants and the maintenance of all the workloads of Office 365. Being a demo-intensive session, be
prepared to see a lot of PowerShell and Office 365 API code!"

Thanks everyone who attended my session and I hope I will have the chance to give more webinars with the European
SharePoint Community next year!
