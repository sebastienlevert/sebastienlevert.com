title: MVP Virtual Conference - AngularJS and the Office 365 Unified API
---

During last MVP Virtual Conference that took place May 14th and May 15th 205, I had the chance to host a session with a
good friend of mine, Vincent Biret, that was about how we can leverage the Office 365 Unified API from an AngularJS
application. I learned a ton of stuff preparing for this session because the initial goal was to talk about the Office
365 API, but not the Unified version of the APIs... Then during Build, the Office 365 Unified APIs were announced, and
decided to jump into the Preview and use this set of tools for my session!

What was even more crazy, is that the day before the session, I decided to go all-in in the client side development and
decided to use Visual Studio Code alongside NodeJS on my Mac... I never tried that before, but it is so easy that in an
hour everything was set up and I was ready to give my talk without any problem! I love when it works, and this time, it
worked like a charm!
