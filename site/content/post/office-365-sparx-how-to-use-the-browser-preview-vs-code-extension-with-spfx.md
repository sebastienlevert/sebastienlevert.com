##Office 365 Sparx
This video is part of a video series of quick tips and tricks about the overall SharePoint and Office 365 space. Less writing, short videos, to the point. The idea is that after 2 or 3 minutes of watching time, your can already benefit from the content I'm sharing.

##How to use the Browser Preview VS Code Extension with #SPFx
I'm using Visual Studio Code (almost) everyday and I was excited when the [Browser Preview VS Code Extension](https://github.com/auchenberg/vscode-browser-preview) was announced as I really think this can speed up your development workflow! 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing Browser Preview for <a href="https://twitter.com/code?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@code</a> â€“ a real browser preview inside your editor that you can debug ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¤©ðŸ’¥ Stay in the loop, and get things done!<br><br>ðŸ‘‰ <a href="https://t.co/z5vTIYZU7R">https://t.co/z5vTIYZU7R</a><br><br>(a personal project of mine from the holidays ðŸŽ„) <a href="https://t.co/AvTFWJXHKu">pic.twitter.com/AvTFWJXHKu</a></p>â€” Kenneth Auchenberg (@auchenberg) <a href="https://twitter.com/auchenberg/status/1087508399732883456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2019</a></blockquote>

I was thinking "I'm sure this would work super nicely with the Local and Hosted Workbench of SharePoint... Let me test this out"! And you know what? It's pure awesomeness!
