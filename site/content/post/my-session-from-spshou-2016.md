Last week, on April 9th, I had the privilege to travel to the vibrant city of Houston. I had the priviledge to be selected as a speaker at their latest [SharePoint Saturday Houston](http://www.spsevents.org/city/Houston/Houston2016)! I gave a deep-dive session on the Microsoft Graph.

The session's abstract was the following :

"Since the launch of the Microsoft Graph, a ton of new possibilities are being made available for IT Pros and Developers. This session is a deep-dive into the Microsoft Graph by analyzing the current /v1.0 version of the API and what is coming on the future /beta endpoint. We will also learn how we can build multiple types of applications that integrate nicely with the Microsoft Graph.

The 3 key takeaways of this session are : 

- You will be able to connect to the Microsoft Graph from multiple platforms (.NET, PowerShell, AngularJS, ...)
- You will understand the impact of the Graph in the new Microsoft and how you will benefit from this API
- You will have access to a ton of code letting you reproduce every demos from the session"

Thanks everyone who attended my session and I hope I will have the chance to come back in Houston next year for a community-related event!
