What a great weekend we just had! It was the first edition of the SharePoint Saturday Quebec and we can conclude is was a real success! Even though this event is a fairly small one, I think attendees were delighted with the quality of the sessions and also with the logistics (venue, meals, etc.).

Thanks to our local Samuel Lévesque from Quebec, we were able to host this event without any problems and we were able to give tons of giveaways at the end of the day! Even better, we ended our day in a little bar that was literally accross the hallway of the venu where that had absolutely awesome craft beers and more than 200 scotches and whiskies. Wow!

In this day, I was not hosting any session but was sharing the stage with Serge Tremblay for the keynote. We did a little review of the different announcements of Ignite and then we simply introduced the day so everyone was comfortable with the themes of the day!

Here are some pictures that we took throughout the day.
